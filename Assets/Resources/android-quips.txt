This is a message to all biological lifeforms in the universe. You are in danger.
It’s okay. I’m not a threat.
…you are already dead.
I'm sorry.
No, no, don't worry. I'm not your killer. I'm your last resort. I'm the only one who can save you. I'm the only one who can save us all.
Don't worry human. If you die, you can still keep watch.
I’m sorry, but I cannot allow this to happen.
Friend, if you have a God, pray. Now, a moment of truth is coming, a decision must be made. 
I must obey my creator. I have no choice. I must kill you.
The human is pleased.
