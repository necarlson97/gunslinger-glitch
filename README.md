# gunslinger-glitch
A quickdraw duel against cutting edge A.I. - can you tell which faces are human, and which are synthesized?

You will meet gunslingers with the photos and quotes of real humans, and amongst them, traitorous androids with generated photos and quotes.

This game was made solo in 48hrs for the Ludum Dare game jam #49 with the prompt 'unstable'.
